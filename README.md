# goodreads-tool-pagecount

Sorts Goodreads exported data (CSV) and reads out the pagecount per unique bookshelf. 

If you have your books sorted by bookshelf (barring the defaults on goodreads), this tool will help you to determine how many pages are in each bookshelf. This is done with the exported values from the goodreads website.
